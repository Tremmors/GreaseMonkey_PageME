GreaseMonkey_PageMe
By John Trimis

This is a greasemonkey script that allows you to use your keyboard to "click" next and previous.
This finds all anchor tags and tries to figure out where the Next and Previous buttons are (if they exist)

[CTRL] + [Right Arrow] OR [Shift] + [PageDown] to click Next
[CTRL] + [Left Arrow] OR [Shift] + [PageUp] to click Previous
